Thank you for purchasing a license for this song!

Below are some simple instructions:

-The song is split in two files: A short one-time intro and a long loop.
-The end of the one-time intro is made to connect seamlessly to the beginning of the loop.
-The loop can be used on its own.
-A third file contains both parts, if you need program a point at which this file loops, that would be sample 649551 or 00:14.729

Enjoy!
