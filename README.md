# How do I use the overlay on my stream?

Adding the overlay to your stream is super simple!

1. Add the following link as you browser source to your streaming software (like OBS): [https://talk2megooseman.github.io/twitch-interactive-overlay/?channel=YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME_HERE](https://talk2megooseman.github.io/twitch-interactive-overlay?channel=YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME_HERE)

2. Change the YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME_HERE in the url to match your channel's name like the following: https://talk2megooseman.github.io/twitch-interactive-overlay/?channel=talk2megooseman

3. Now the overlay will connect to your channel, use !controls to see the latest commands
